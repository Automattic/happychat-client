# Dist

This directory contains the bare assets Happychat uses.

Note that happychat.css is automatically requested once the Happychat component is initialized. You never need this embedded in your page manually. It's served from https://widgets.wp.com/happychat/happychat.css so any time it's updated it needs to be uploaded for changes to take effect.
