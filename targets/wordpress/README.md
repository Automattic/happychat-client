# WordPress plugin

The `targets/wordpress/plugin` directory is a complete WordPress plugin that you can copy to your WordPress installation and enjoy Happychatting!

Upon changes on the JavaScript library at `src/` you'll need to re-build it for WordPress. By executing `npm run targets:wordpress' the `targets/wordpress/plugin/assets/happychat.js` will be updated with the latest changes.
